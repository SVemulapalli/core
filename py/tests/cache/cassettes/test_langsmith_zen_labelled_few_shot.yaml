        (Grade School Math 8K) is a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse
        grade school math word problems. The dataset was created to support the task
        of question answering on basic mathematical problems that require multi-step
        reasoning.\\n\\nThese problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve.\\nSolutions
        primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic
        arithmetic operations (+ \u2212 \xD7\xF7) to\u2026 See the full description
